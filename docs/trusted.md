# Trusted base

Everything the proofs rely on but do not prove, and how each item is checked instead. Each
entry is an `assume`: a statement about the world we take as given, with its evidence. Add
entries in the section of the workstream that introduces the assumption.

## Renderer and text (workstream F)

See docs/render.md for the design.

### Text metrics match what is painted (`assume`)

**Statement.** For every font and string, the caret offsets, ascent and descent that
`TextMetrics.host` returns are those of the Core Text line the renderer draws for the same
`Draw.text`: the glyphs of a text draw at baseline origin `o` lie within
`[o.x, o.x + width] × [o.y − ascent, o.y + descent]`, where `width` is the last offset, and the
caret offset at scalar boundary `i` is Core Text's primary caret offset there, rounded up to a
whole point.

**Scope.** Text is single-line and left-to-right in M1. Right-to-left and bidirectional text are
out of scope: their offsets are made nondecreasing by a running max and are not meaningful
carets. Scalar boundaries inside a grapheme cluster report the cluster's end, so several
consecutive offsets can be equal (the caret appears to stall over "é" written as e + U+0301, or
a ZWJ emoji); grapheme clusters are not modelled in M1. Italic and some fallback scripts
(Arabic) overhang the box by up to 1 pt of ink.

**What is not assumed.** `TextMetrics.Valid` (offsets start at 0, never decrease, one per
scalar boundary; ascent and descent nonnegative) is *proved* for `TextMetrics.host`
(`Cairn.TextMetrics.host_valid`): Lean normalises whatever bytes the host returns. Layout
theorems quantify over every valid metrics, so they hold for Core Text's whatever it reports.

**Trusted code.** `host/Sources/CairnRender/TextSystem.swift` (shaping, UTF-16 boundary mapping,
rounding), `Fonts.swift` (Font → CTFont), `Metrics.swift` (the C export),
`lean/c/text_host.c` (the Lean ABI glue and the weak stand-in), and Core Text itself.

**Evidence.**
- `LeanMetricsTests`: Lean's `TextMetrics.host`, called through the real `@[extern]`, glue and
  export, equals the renderer's shaped line for 5 fonts × 11 strings, and the Swift
  implementation (not the weak stand-in) is linked.
- `MetricsTests`: the host's output is already valid (no normalisation needed) for 8 fonts ×
  24 strings including emoji, CJK, combining marks, RTL, NUL and BOM; offsets come from one line
  (kerning); boundaries never land mid-surrogate.
- `InkTests`: the painted pixels of every sample text draw lie inside the box Lean computes
  (upright LTR text: exactly; italic and RTL: within 1 pt), at 1x and 2x.
- To do (workstream G/J): log every measurement in the running app and replay the log against a
  fresh Core Text in conformance runs, as the `assume` claim's runtime evidence.

### The renderer paints the frame (`assume`)

**Statement.** `Renderer` paints `frame.draws` in order, later on top; a rect paints exactly the
device pixels whose centres lie inside it (edges snapped `⌈v·s − ½⌉`), with its border inside it
and its corners rounded; nothing paints outside the intersection of the clips pushed around it;
text paints its glyphs at the positions Core Text gives, relative to its baseline origin.

**Trusted code.** `host/Sources/CairnRender/Renderer.swift`, `Shaders.swift`,
`GlyphAtlas.swift`, Metal and the GPU driver, Core Graphics' glyph rasterisation.

**Evidence.** Golden images at 1x, 1.5x and 2x with tolerances; pixel-probe tests (exact fills,
borders, clips, order, seams, antialiasing width); `Renderer.probe` for conformance checks that
each control's box is painted (workstream J). Choices that affect only the look, not what is
painted where: grayscale antialiasing with font smoothing off, gamma-space blending into
`bgra8Unorm`, sRGB colours (the host must set the layer's colour space to sRGB).

**Also assumed.** Frames have balanced `pushClip`/`popClip`; an extra `popClip` is ignored and
counted (`RenderStats.unbalancedPops`) rather than trusted.
