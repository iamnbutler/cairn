/-! The trusted base's assumptions (docs/trusted.md), each naming the check of the trusted-base
fuzzer that gathers its evidence (`make fuzz-trusted`, `build/fuzz/trusted.json`, docs/fuzz.md
"Trusted base"). Evidence, not proof: these stay assumptions.

Ids 901–999 are for framework-level assumptions; apps' own assumptions use their apps' ranges.

assume ^901 swiftFrameDecoder "The Swift frame decoder agrees with Lean's" where
  does "For every byte buffer, the host's Frame(bytes:) accepts exactly when Lean's proved decodeFrame does, and then decodes the same frame."
  check "frame.decode"

assume ^902 swiftEventEncoder "Lean decodes what the Swift event encoder writes" where
  does "For every batch of events, Lean's proved decodeEvents decodes the host's encodeEvents bytes to the same events, and Lean's encoder gives back the same bytes."
  check "events.encode"

assume ^903 textIndex "UTF-16 offsets and scalar indices convert exactly" where
  does "TextIndex maps between AppKit's UTF-16 offsets and Lean's scalar indices exactly on boundaries, rounds offsets inside a surrogate pair to a whole scalar, and clamps AppKit ranges (NSNotFound, negative, past the end) to whole scalars."
  check "text.index"

assume ^904 textShadow "The text-input shadow predicts Lean's field" where
  does "Between an input-method call and the frame that reflects it, the host's copy of the focused field has the text, selection and marked range Lean's field will show."
  check "text.shadow"

assume ^905 inputClientGeometry "Input-method geometry agrees with Lean's caret" where
  does "selectedRange and markedRange are Lean's, firstRect at the selection is Lean's caret, and characterIndex(for:) maps points back to scalar boundaries of the field."
  check "text.input-client"

assume ^906 textMetricsHost "The host's text metrics are what layout assumes" where
  does "cairn_text_metrics gives one offset per scalar boundary, from 0 and nondecreasing, with nonnegative ascent and descent, and Lean's TextMetrics.host sees those numbers unchanged."
  check "text.metrics"

assume ^907 textCaretsPainted "Carets follow the painted glyphs" where
  does "On left-to-right text, the caret offset after each grapheme is at or right of every glyph painted for the text before it."
  check "text.metrics.carets"
